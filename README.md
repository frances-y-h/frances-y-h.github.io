<p>Hi I'm Frances. I grew up in California.

I worked as a real estate broker and loan officer. Soon I realized to stay in business, sometimes it requires me to bend the truth. I decided to change my career.

I love crafting things to make life easier for myself and others. Building websites and databases has been one of them. In my 6 month journey with App Academy, I have spent more than 1000 hours to learn computer science concepts and applying them to built projects, both on my own and collaborating with other engineers. I have completed four full stack projects utilizing React, Redux, Express, Python and Flask.

I am a fast learner and a perfectionist. I can easily adopt to any work environment and love to learn new skills.</p>
